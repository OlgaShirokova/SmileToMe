## Motivation

Today the technology is changing our lives and changing our social habbits, also limiting strongly the quantity go time that we interact with other people in real time and this way makes us lose social skills and social unity. Our aim is to refer this effect and use technology to enhance real life connections, to bring the people back together in reality and help people get to know those around them. 

This will be performed through challenges, that will consist in meeting another person chosen by the application through several matching mechanisms who is some limited distance away from you and do it in a limited quantity of time and in case the two people meet on time and confirm that they met they will both receive visual points that could be later exchanged in partner establishments, such as shops of coffee shops. When a person is not enrolled in challenges he has always the option to see the map in the app and see there all the people who right now are willing to meet others and interact with them with freedom and confidence.
